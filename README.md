- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marcos Maia or simply @mamgjunior
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a software developer and I work developing desktop and web applications, both monolithically and distributed as micro services and I'm really excited about the cybersecurity area because I'm aiming to become a DevSecOps.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently studying and working with Python, TypeScript and their technologies. I'm also studying and working with the following Django web frameworks for the backend and React for the frontend and I'm really enjoying it.
